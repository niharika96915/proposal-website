            Dear Pranjal,  
            <br><br>
            From the moment I met you, my world has been brighter and happier. Your smile is my sunshine, and your laughter is my favorite melody.  
            <br><br>
            Every moment with you feels magical, and I can’t imagine my life without you. You are the reason behind my happiest days, and I want to create countless memories with you.  
            <br><br>
            So, here I am, with all my heart, asking you...  
        </p>
